Loan Approval Prediction in Banking

**AIM:** Financial Institutions make various loans and advances to businesses, corporations, and individuals. The interest on these loans is their primary source of income. They grant a loan after a lengthy verification process. However, it does not guarantee that the applicant will be able to repay the loan without difficulty. Thus, the risks associated with making a loan approval decision are enormous. Through this research, the student researcher hopes to develop a model that can provide our client “Dream Housing Finance” with a fair idea about their customers’ segments who are eligible for the home loan amounts. It would also allow them to automate the loan eligibility procedure in real-time based on the information provided by a consumer through an application form.

**DATA:** The secondary research method is used for the research purpose (Source: Datahack). The dataset is structured which means that the target is already defined. It contains home loan application details of 614 customers of “Dream Housing Finance” on several parameters which are considered important during the application for loans.

**METHODOLOGY:** To achieve the most accurate results, the student researcher will go through several steps, including data preprocessing (imputing null values, duplicate values check, encoding categorical columns, and handling the imbalanced data), and model selection, to train a binary logistic regression model, make predictions, and measure its performance.
